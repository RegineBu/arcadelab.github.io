In the Advanced Robotics and Computationally AugmenteD Environments (ARCADE) Lab, we develop
collaborative intelligent systems that support clinical workflows to increase the access to - and
expand the possibilities of - highest-quality healthcare. In designing these systems, we pioneer
human-centered solutions that are enabled by synergistic advancements across imaging, computer
vision, machine learning, and interaction design and that are embodied in emerging technology such
as mixed reality and robotics.
