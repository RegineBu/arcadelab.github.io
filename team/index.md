We are looking for motivated students interested in the intersection of computer science, vision,
and health. 

PhD applicants may apply through Johns Hopkins graduate admissions, being sure to note Mathias
Unberath as their primary faculty member of interest.

Masters and undergraduate students should reach out to Prof. Unberath directly, being sure to
include area of interest, time frame, and the type of work (Masters thesis, general research, etc).
Applicants may wish to identify a PhD student whose interests align with theirs, who could
supervise.
