# Empowering Clinicians with Autonomous Intelligent Systems

In the Advanced Robotics and Computationally AugmenteD Environments (ARCADE) Lab, we develop
collaborative intelligent systems that support clinical workflows to increase the access to - and
expand the possibilities of - highest-quality healthcare. In designing these systems, we pioneer
human-centered solutions that are enabled by synergistic advancements across imaging, computer
vision, machine learning, and interaction design and that are embodied in emerging technology such
as mixed reality and robotics.

ARCADE Lab is based on Homewood Campus at [Johns Hopkins University](https://jhu.edu). We are
affiliated with the [Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/) and
the [Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare](https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/).
