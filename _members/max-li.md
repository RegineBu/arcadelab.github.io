A Ph.D. Student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), I am interested in surgical robotics with vision-based guidance. I am supervised by Prof. [Mathias Unberath](https://mathiasunberath.github.io/) and Prof. [Russ Taylor](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~rht/). More information about myself can be found at my personal website.
