I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). Before that, I received my Bachelor degree in Biomedical Engineering at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) with honor in 2022 and Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in 2023. My research focus on creating a digital twin environment for providing patient care, using methods in artificial intelligence, robotics, and mixed reality.
