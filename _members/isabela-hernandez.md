I am a visiting graduate scholar at the Advanced Robotics and Computationally Augmented
Environments (ARCADE) Laboratory and M.Sc. student in Biomedical Engineering at [Universidad de los Andes](https://ingbiomedica.uniandes.edu.co) (Colombia). I am a member of the [Biomedical Computer Vision](https://biomedicalcomputervision.uniandes.edu.co) research group led by Prof. [Pablo Arbelaez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k0nZO90AAAAJ&hl=en) and a researcher at the [Center for Research and Formation in Artificial Intelligence](https://cinfonia.uniandes.edu.co) (CINFONIA), both at Universidad de los Andes. My general interests lie within the research and development of solutions to support clinical workflows, employing characteristic Deep Learning tools.
