My research focuses on aiding medical image analysis through artifical intelligence as well as recognizing and mitigating bias in algorithms towards underrepresented groups.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing piano and guitar, drawing, and exercising. I have been traveling more due to work from home (as of 2021), which has been great. 

I should probably talk more about my research.
