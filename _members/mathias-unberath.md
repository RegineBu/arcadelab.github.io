I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University and
affiliated with the Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics and the Malone Center for
Engineering in Healthcare.

I have created and am leading the ARCADE research group on Advanced Robotics and Computationally
AugmenteD Environments. We develop collaborative intelligent systems that support clinical workflows
to increase the access to – and expand the possibilities of highest-quality healthcare. In designing
these systems, we pioneer human-centered solutions that are enabled by synergistic advancements
across imaging, computer vision, machine learning, and interaction design and that are embodied in
emerging technology such as mixed reality and robotics.

Previously, I was an Assistant Research Professor in Computer Science and postdoctoral fellow in the
Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics at Hopkins, and completed my PhD in Computer
Science at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg from which I graduated summa cum
laude in 2017. While completing a Bachelor’s in Physics and Master’s in Optical Technologies at FAU
Erlangen, I studied at the University of Eastern Finland as ERASMUS scholar in 2011 and joined
Stanford University as DAAD fellow throughout 2014.

I have published more than 80 journal and conference articles, and have received numerous awards,
grants, and fellowships, including the NIH NIBIB R21 Trailblazer Award. For a comprehensive list of
publications, among other things, please refer to either my CV or Google Scholar.

I am teaching CS482/682 Machine Learning: Deep Learning and CS486/686 Artificial Intelligent System
Design and Development, a new projects-based course focused on human-centered AI. More information
on my teaching is available at deep.cs.jhu.edu/.
