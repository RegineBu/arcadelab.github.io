I am a fifth year computer science PhD candidate at the Johns Hopkins University. I work in the
SMARTS lab directed by Peter Kazanzides. My focus is on improving teleoperation using the da Vinci
Reserach Kit and synthesizing low-level signals using machine learning techniques to provide
high-level information. Some examples are using current measurements as a proxy for forces and using
data-driven methods to improve soft-tissue simulation results.
