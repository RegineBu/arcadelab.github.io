I am a first-year student in the Robotics MSE program at Johns Hopkins University. I am interested in working on deep learning applications for clinical decision support. Before coming here, I graduated from Earlham College, a small liberal arts college, with a bachelor's degree in Physics and a minor in Computer Science.
