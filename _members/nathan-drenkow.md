I am currently a PhD Student in Computer Science at the Johns Hopkins University and a senior research scientist at the JHU Applied Physics Laboratory. I got my BS from Cornell University and MS from Johns Hopkins University both in Electrical and Computer Engineering.  My research interests center around real-world robustness of computer vision and deep learning systems.
