I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. I am now working on a different causal view of deep learning applications for medical image analysis. Before coming here, I earned my master degree in Robotics MSE program at Johns Hopkins University in 2020 and my bachelor degree in Department of Computer Science and Technology of Tsinghua University in 2018.
