I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), supervised by Prof. [Mathias Unberath](https://mathiasunberath.github.io/). Before starting my PhD journey, I received my Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering at the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) with first-class honour in 2017 and Master degree in Robotics at Johns Hopkins University in 2019. My research focus on applying mixed reality and computer vision algorithms to help surgeons better treat their patients.
