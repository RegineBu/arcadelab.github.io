I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. Previously, I obtained my master's degree in MSE Robotics from Johns Hopkins University in the summer of 2023. My research focuses on leveraging computer vision and mixed reality to explore the applications of digital twins in healthcare.
