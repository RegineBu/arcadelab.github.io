I am a visiting student in the Advanced Robotics and Computationally Augmented Environments (ARCADE) research group, supervised by Prof. [Mathias Unberath](https://mathiasunberath.github.io/), at Johns Hopkins University. I am now working on the identification of glaucoma and its worsening using machine learning. Before coming here, I'm a graduate student in Medical Engineering at [Friedrich Alexander University](https://www.fau.de/). I earned my bachelor's degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation of North China Electric Power University.
