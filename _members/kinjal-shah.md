I am a recent graduate of the MSE in Robotics program at Johns Hopkins University where I concentrated in perception and cognitive systems. I completed my master's thesis as a member of the ARCADE lab advised by Professor Mathias Unberath. My master's thesis focused on improving human-AI interactions in mixed reality by estimating cognitive effort from eye-tracking in unconstrained environments to enable adaptive, cognitive load aware user interfaces. I am passionate about applications of AI for Social Good; in particular, designing technologies that improve accessibility or enable personalized healthcare.
